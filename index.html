                <h5>BIRTH</h5>
                <p>Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ,
                    is believed to have been born in Bethlehem around 4 to 6 B.C.
                    According to Christian tradition, his birth marks a significant
                    event in human history and is celebrated on December 25th. 
                    The Gospels of Matthew and Luke describe his miraculous conception 
                    through the Holy Spirit and his birth to the Virgin Mary. The event
                    is central to the Christian faith, symbolizing God's incarnation in human form.
                </p>

                <h5>MISSION</h5>
                <p>Jesus' mission was characterized by teachings of love, compassion, and redemption. 
                    He gathered disciples and preached about the Kingdom of God, urging people to repent 
                    and turn to a life of righteousness. His ministry included performing miracles, such 
                    as healing the sick and raising the dead, to demonstrate divine authority. His teachings 
                    emphasized forgiveness, humility, and selflessness. Jesus' ultimate mission, according 
                    to Christian belief, was to provide salvation through his sacrificial death on the cross, 
                    serving as atonement for humanity's sins.
                </p>

                <h5>DEATH</h5>
                <p>Jesus' crucifixion is a pivotal event in Christian theology. He was arrested, tried, and 
                    sentenced to death by crucifixion. According to the Gospels, he willingly accepted this 
                    fate as part of his divine purpose. Christians believe that through his death, Jesus took 
                    on the sins of humanity, offering a path to reconciliation with God. Three days later, Christians 
                    celebrate the Resurrection, asserting that Jesus rose from the dead, conquering sin and death. 
                    This event is foundational to the Christian faith, symbolizing the hope of eternal life for believers.
